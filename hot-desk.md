# hot-desk

Guide the workforce through today's hybrid office workspace!

Enterprise mobility has become synonymous with flexible working practices and remote working options. At the same time there exists emergent pressure to optimise costs.

## Problem

Companies practice a popular trend when COVID enters an endemic phase. Costs are reduced by assuming workforce that wants to perform a part time on-site and home office routine. Examples of this strategy include telecommuting, home-working, shared offices and _hot-desking_.

How to ensure a fair and sufficient environment for workers on-site?

"I have to quickly look for a vacant desk for my TEAMS meeting starting 2 minutes ago."
"Today I need to refactor this particularly messy code made by someone else ( or my self 2 weeks ago), I need some quiet space for this"
